### ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Bixin.

Friends pronounce my name as Biks-in or BÃ¬ xÄ«n. Thanks for visiting!

This is my personal playground, where I display programs I built from ground up! I've worked on a bunch of cool projects for classes and school organizations on my school account, too, but I'm unfortunately not allowed to disclose the source code as per Cornell's academic integrity policy. I am, however, happy to show you some screenshots and possibly demo if you are interested!
